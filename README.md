# pokedex-test
For testing purposes. 
# To install
1. Download client and server
2. Open command prompt, locate the server folder and run "npm install"
3. After installation of node packages, run "npm run dev"
4. by default express server will hosted in port 3090. where you see message stating "Server listening on 3090" mean the server is up.
5. Same goes to client, now open a new command prompt and locate the client folder and run "npm install"
6. After installation of node packages, run "npm start". When client is running, it will indicate the address.
   For example, "Project is running at http://localhost:8081". It means the client webpage is hosted on localhost port 8081. 
7. Enter the url into the browser and start testing the system. Thanks.
